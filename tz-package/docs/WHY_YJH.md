# Why YJH

## Problem
QA teams frequently split workflows across several disconnected tools:
- Bugs in one place.
- Test cases/runs in another.
- Knowledge docs in a third.
- Reporting assembled manually.

This causes context switching, weak traceability, and slower releases.

## YJH Solution
YJH unifies the complete QA lifecycle:
- Plan tests.
- Execute tests.
- Convert failures to bugs.
- Link fixes through commits.
- Track release risk on one dashboard.

## Practical Advantages
- Faster onboarding due to one product surface.
- Better decision making from integrated metrics.
- Lower operational overhead for small/mid teams.
- Strong foundation for portfolio and employer demos.
